Python Basics - 1
1. Variables in Python

Variables are used to store data values. They are created when you assign a value to them, and you don’t need to declare their type (Python is dynamically typed).

Syntax for Variable Assignment:
```
x = 5       # Assigning an integer value
y = "Hello" # Assigning a string value
```

Variable Naming Rules:

Can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_)

Must start with a letter or underscore

Case-sensitive (Name and name are different)

Example:
```
age = 25
name = "John"
is_student = True
```

2. Data Types in Python

Python has various built-in data types. Some common ones:

int → integers (1, -3, 100)

float → floating-point numbers (3.14, -0.001)

str → strings ("Hello", "Python")

bool → boolean values (True or False)

Type Checking:
```
x = 10
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```

3. Type Conversion

Python allows you to convert between data types using int(), float(), str(), etc.
```
Example:
x = "10"       # x is a string
y = int(x)     # Convert string to integer
z = float(y)   # Convert integer to float
print(z)       # Output: 10.0
```

4. Arithmetic Operators

Python supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

Common Operators:

+ → Addition

- → Subtraction

* → Multiplication

/ → Division

// → Floor Division

% → Modulus

** → Exponentiation

```
Examples:
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)   # 13
print(a - b)   # 7
print(a * b)   # 30
print(a / b)   # 3.3333...
print(a // b)  # 3
print(a % b)   # 1
print(a ** b)  # 1000
```

5. Assigning Values to Multiple Variables

Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in a single line.
```

Example:
x, y, z = 10, 20, 30
print(x)  # 10
print(y)  # 20
print(z)  # 30
```

You can also assign the same value to multiple variables:

```
x = y = z = 100
print(x, y, z)  # 100 100 100
```

6. Variable Reassignment

You can change the value of a variable at any point in your program.

Example:
```
x = 5
print(x)  # 5
x = 10
print(x)  # 10
```
