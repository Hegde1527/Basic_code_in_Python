# Basic_code_in_Python

This is my very first Python program ✍️

## About Python
- 🐍 Python is a high-level programming language.  
- ✅ It is human understandable and easy to learn.  
- ⚡ Python code is interpreted and executed line by line.  
- 🛠️ If there’s an error, execution stops, so debugging is easier.  
- 📖 It has very simple syntax (almost like English).  

## Code Example
```python
print("Namaskara Karnataka")
````
## How to Run

Install Python (if not installed) → Download here
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Hegde1527/Basic_code_in_Python.git
Navigate to the folder:
cd Simple_code_with_Me
Run the Python file:

python p1.py


## Program 2: Variables 

* Variables are containers that hold data values.
* They are created when we assign a value .
* In python there is no need of declaring variables because Python is dynamically typed.

Variable Naming Rules:

* Variable names can contain letters(A-Z , a-z), numbers(0-9), and underscorea(_ ).
* Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore.
                example: a = 10       ✓
                         234 = hi     X
                        _hello = hi   ✓
  
* x = 5.0
  ---> Assigning a float value to the variable x .
* w = "monkey"
  ----> Assigning a String value to the varible w .

### Code
```

a = 10
b = 20
print(a)              # Output = 10
print(b)              # Output = 20
print("a")            # Output = a
print(a + b)          # Output = 30

```
* a = 10, b = 20 → assigning values to variables.

* print(a) → prints the value stored in a (10).

* print("a") → prints the letter a, not the value.

* print(a+b) → adds the values of a and b (10 + 20 = 30).
