## About Python
- 🐍 Python is a high-level programming language.  
- ✅ It is human understandable and easy to learn.  
- ⚡ Python code is interpreted and executed line by line.  
- 🛠️ If there’s an error, execution stops, so debugging is easier.  
- 📖 It has very simple syntax (almost like English).  

## Code Example
