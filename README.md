# Basic_code_in_Python

This is my very first Python program ✍️

## About Python
- 🐍 Python is a high-level programming language.  
- ✅ It is human understandable and easy to learn.  
- ⚡ Python code is interpreted and executed line by line.  
- 🛠️ If there’s an error, execution stops, so debugging is easier.  
- 📖 It has very simple syntax (almost like English).  

## Code Example
```python
print("Namaskara Karnataka")
````
## How to Run

Install Python (if not installed) → Download here
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Hegde1527/Basic_code_in_Python.git
Navigate to the folder:
cd Simple_code_with_Me
Run the Python file:

python p1.py


## Program 2: Variables and Addition

This program explains how variables work in Python.  

### Code
```python
a = 10
b = 20
print(a)
print(b)
print("a")
print(a + b)

```
Run the Python file:

python p2.py

* Variables are containers that hold data values.

* a = 10, b = 20 → assigning values to variables.

* print(a) → prints the value stored in a (10).

* print("a") → prints the letter a, not the value.

* print(a+b) → adds the values of a and b (10 + 20 = 30).
