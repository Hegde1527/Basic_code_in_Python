##1. Input and Output

input() is used to take user input.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:
```
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

```
Whatever you enter from the keyboard is stored as a string.

To use numbers, we convert them with int() or float().

print() is used to display output.
```

print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age) + " years old.")

```
Or use f-strings for easy formatting:
```
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
```

##2. String Manipulation

Strings are just text values in Python.

âœ… Concatenation

Joining two strings using +
```
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
```
âœ… Repetition

Repeat a string using *
```
greeting = "Hello! " * 3
```
âœ… String Methods

Useful built-in functions for strings:
```
message = "  Hello, World!  "
message.strip()   # Removes extra spaces â†’ "Hello, World!"
message.upper()   # Converts to uppercase â†’ "HELLO, WORLD!"
message.lower()   # Converts to lowercase â†’ "hello, world!"
message.replace("World", "Python")  # Replaces text â†’ "Hello, Python!"
```
##3. Accessing and Slicing Strings

You can access letters using their index:
```
text = "Python"
print(text[0])   # First letter â†’ P
print(text[-1])  # Last letter â†’ n
```

You can also take parts (slices) of a string:
```
text2 = "Python Programming"
print(text2[0:6])  # "Python"
print(text2[7:])   # "Programming"
```
##4. Comments

Comments are notes you write inside the code.
They are not executed by Python.

Single-line comment: starts with #
```
# This is a comment
```

Multi-line comment: use triple quotes
```
"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
```
##5. Escape Sequences

Used to insert special characters inside strings.
```
Escape	Meaning	Example Output
\n	New line	Hello
World
\t	Tab space	Helloâ€ƒPython
\\	Backslash	\
```

Example:
```
print("Hello\nWorld")   # New line
print("Hello\tPython")  # Tab space
print("This is a backslash \\")
```
##6. Character Counter (Mini Program)

Counts the number of characters (excluding spaces).
```
usr_string = input("Enter a string: ")
count = len(user_string.replace(" ", ""))
print("Number of characters (excluding spaces):", count)
```

ðŸ§  Logic:
replace(" ", "") removes spaces, and len() counts how many characters remain.
